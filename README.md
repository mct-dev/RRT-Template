# React / Redux / Typescript - TEMPLATE

This is a template / boilerplate code for using React and Redux with Typescript.

It includes:
 - intro code from `create-react-app --typescript`
 - tslint settings that work with Prettier
 - starter code for using actions, reducers, and react/redux.
   - this code just pulls a list of todos from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos`, displays them on the screen, and allows you to delete them by clicking on them.  No changes are saved to DB - only state.

### To Run...
 - `yarn` or `npm install`
 - `yarn start` or `npm start`
