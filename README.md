# React / Redux / Typescript / Storybook - TEMPLATE

This is a template / boilerplate code for using React and Redux with Typescript. It also includes [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), a tool for building components in isolation and maintaining a component library.  Testing and linting (tslint) are also included.

### To Run...
 - `npm install`
 - `npm start`

### Notes
 - `tslint` is the best linting solution I could find at the moment for Typescript. **However,** Palantir (the maintainer) has publicly announced that they will be depricating `tslint` in favor of a typescript integration with `eslint`.  This effort is supported by Microsoft as well. As of 09/12/2019, I can say that the `eslint`-typescript integration is not yet finished.  I was unable to get it working easily in this project and ended up going back to `tslint`.
