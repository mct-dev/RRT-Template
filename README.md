# React / Redux / Typescript - TEMPLATE

This is a template / boilerplate code for using React and Redux with Typescript.

It includes:
 - starter code for using actions, reducers, and react/redux.
 - introductory **tests** for redux logic.
 - an example of how to implement "protected" routes with `react-router`.
 - a very simple "todo" example, which fetches todos from an opensource fake json api and allows you to delete them by clicking on them.
 - tslint settings that work with Prettier.

### To Run...
 - `yarn` or `npm install`
 - `yarn start` or `npm start`
